Hello, I am a senior engineer with experience in the field of software control, R&D and electrical engineering.

Here I will be uploading new and old code which I have developed in my own time, for the most part in Python or C++. 

Also see my blog on github pages at [bott-j.github.io](https://bott-j.github.io/) where I post on various engineering and science topics.
